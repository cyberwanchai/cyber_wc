## Motivation

This project stems from a passion for preserving and sharing Hong Kong's rich cultural heritage through the lens of historical photography and digital storytelling. As someone fascinated by urban history and the transformation of cities over time, I wanted to create an accessible platform that showcases Hong Kong's architectural legacy and cultural evolution.

The application serves as both a historical archive and an educational resource, making Hong Kong's history more accessible to both locals and visitors interested in understanding the city's development through visual storytelling.

#### Project Evolution

The application has evolved from a basic mapping interface to a comprehensive historical exploration platform, incorporating user-friendly design principles and rich multimedia content presentation.

----

## Future Development

The development of this project will continue to expand the historical archive and enhance the user experience for exploring Hong Kong's heritage. We plan to continuously add new locations, photographs, and historical content while improving the platform's functionality.

## Local Setup Guide

Follow these instructions to run the Hong Kong Historical Photo Gallery application locally on your machine.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the project from the GitHub repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd cyber_wc
```

### Step 2: Set Up the Project with uv

This project uses [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast and reliable dependency management. If you don't have `uv` installed, you can install it from the official documentation.

```bash
# Install dependencies using uv (recommended)
uv sync
```

### Step 4: Set Up Environment Variables

For enhanced features like AI-powered content suggestions, create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
# Create .env file
touch .env
```

Add following to the .env file:
```bash
FLASK_ENV=development
```

### Step 4: Run the Application

```bash
# Using uv (recommended)
uv run cyber_wc_app.py

# Alternative: Activate virtual environment and run
# uv creates a virtual environment automatically, but you can also run:
source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# OR on Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
python michelin_app.py
```

The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8050` or `http://localhost:8050`.

### Development Mode

For local development with hot-reloading:

1. The app runs in development mode by default when using `uv run`
2. Any changes to Python files will automatically restart the server
3. Debug mode is enabled for better error reporting
