# Blue House (藍屋)

## Introduction

The Blue House is a distinctive four-storey historic tenement building located at 72-74A Stone Nullah Lane in the Wan Chai district of Hong Kong Island. Built in **1923**, this remarkable structure stands as one of the few surviving pre-war buildings in Hong Kong, offering a rare glimpse into the architectural heritage and community life of early 20th century Hong Kong.

## The Blue Color: A Film Legacy

The iconic blue color that gives the building its name has a fascinating origin story. The building was **not originally painted blue** at all. According to historical records, it was painted blue in the **1970s** specifically for use as a filming location in the Shaw Brothers Studio film **"72 Tenants"** (released in 1973). The vibrant blue color proved so distinctive and memorable that it was retained, and the building has been known as the "Blue House" ever since.

The neighboring buildings also received colorful facades and are now collectively known as:
- **Blue House** (藍屋)
- **Yellow House** (黃屋)
- **Orange House** (橙屋)

Together, these form what is now called the **Blue House Cluster**, a unique collection of heritage buildings in the heart of Wan Chai.

## Architectural Significance

### Traditional Construction

The Blue House is **largely made of wood** and represents one of the finest remaining examples of traditional Hong Kong *tong lau* (唐樓) or tenement house architecture. This architectural style features:

- **Four-storey wooden structure**: Built using traditional techniques from the 1920s
- **Cantilevered balconies**: Extending from the upper floors, typical of the era
- **Shop-house design**: Ground floor for commerce, upper floors for residence
- **Mixed-use functionality**: Combining residential and commercial spaces
- **Communal facilities**: Shared kitchen and basic amenities

### Pre-War Living Conditions

The Blue House preserves authentic early 20th century living conditions. When originally built, and for many decades after, the building lacked many modern conveniences:

- **No running hot water**: Residents had to heat water manually
- **No modern plumbing**: Not connected to the city's waste-water system
- **Bucket toilet system**: Human waste was flushed with buckets of water through gutters outside the building
- **Night soil collection**: City waste management collected waste at night
- **Communal kitchen**: All inhabitants shared a single communal cooking space

These conditions, while challenging, were typical of working-class housing in Hong Kong during that era and highlight the significant improvements in living standards over the past century.

### Grade I Historic Building

In **2009**, the Blue House received **Grade I Historic Building** status, the highest level of heritage protection in Hong Kong. This classification means it is a building "of outstanding merit, which every effort should be made to preserve if possible."

## Location and District Context

The Blue House is situated on **Stone Nullah Lane** in **Wan Chai**, a busy commercial area that has been in development since **1850**. The name "Wan Chai" translates to "cove" or "small bay," referring to a small indentation in the shoreline that once existed here.

Over time, as Hong Kong continuously reclaimed land from the harbor to create more building space, the original cove completely disappeared. The area transformed from a waterfront district into the dense commercial and residential neighborhood we see today. The Blue House stands as a reminder of the area's layered history.

## Hung Kyun Martial Arts Heritage

One of the Blue House's most culturally significant aspects is its deep connection to **Hung Kyun** (洪拳) martial arts, a traditional southern Chinese kung fu style.

### Lam Family Legacy

While some sources claim that the legendary martial artist **Lam Sai Wing** (林世榮) had a school in the building, it is more probable that he operated a school somewhere else in the same Wan Chai area that has since been demolished. However, the Blue House definitely housed the school and clinic of his students and descendants:

**Lam Cho (林祖)**
- Lam Sai Wing's nephew and student
- Established a kung fu school and **ditda clinic** in the Blue House in the **1950s**
- Moved into the building after the war with his entire family
- Known for his mastery of Hung Gar techniques

**Lam Chun Hin (林振顯)**
- Son of Lam Cho
- Continued operating the kung fu school
- Particularly passionate about traditional martial arts
- Tragically died young from cancer
- His widow continued running the **ditda clinic** for many years

> **Note**: *Ditda* (跌打) refers to "hit and fall medicine," a form of traditional Chinese sports medicine practiced by kung fu masters. Many martial arts instructors relied on ditda practice for their income, as teaching kung fu itself provided little to no financial return.

This martial arts heritage makes the Blue House a significant site for practitioners and historians of Chinese martial arts, representing a tangible link to Hong Kong's kung fu history.

## Wan Chai District: A Historical Overview

Wan Chai has been a bustling district since the mid-19th century. As Hong Kong developed, the area became known for:

- Small to medium-sized businesses
- Working-class residential neighborhoods
- Traditional shops and markets
- Red-light district reputation (historically)
- Waterfront activities and maritime trades

The Blue House, surviving from 1923 to the present day, has witnessed the entire modern transformation of Wan Chai from a waterfront district to a dense urban center. Ground and building prices in Hong Kong are extremely high, leading to the demolition of countless old buildings to make way for modern high-rises. That the Blue House survived is remarkable and testament to the community's commitment to preservation.

## Conservation and Revitalization

### The Challenge of Preservation

While **Grade I Historic Building** status provides significant recognition, it does not guarantee protection. In the twenty years leading up to the Blue House's restoration, **five buildings with the same Grade I classification were demolished**. This sobering fact highlights how vulnerable even officially protected heritage buildings can be in Hong Kong's fast-paced development environment.

### 2011 Restoration

The Blue House's future became more secure with a major restoration completed in **2011**, costing **100 million Hong Kong dollars** (not billion - likely a translation error in some sources). This comprehensive restoration was part of a larger project that included:

- The Blue House itself
- The neighboring Yellow House and Orange House
- Eight other characteristic buildings in Wan Chai
- Infrastructure improvements to the area

### The Kung Fu Center Proposal

In the early 2010s, the **International Guoshu Association** (國術總會) made an ambitious proposal to transform the Blue House into a comprehensive **center for kung fu**. The proposal included:

- A modern facility for teaching traditional kung fu
- Integration of martial arts training with modern sports science
- A library dedicated to martial arts literature
- A museum showcasing kung fu history
- A multifunctional movie and lecture room
- A teahouse in the neighboring Yellow House
- A kung fu-themed restaurant

This proposal would have honored the building's martial arts heritage while creating a living cultural center. Unfortunately, despite its merits, **the proposal was turned down**. The reasons for rejection are not fully documented, but likely involved concerns about commercialization, operational feasibility, or competing visions for the space.

### UNESCO Recognition

The Blue House Cluster's revitalization was internationally recognized when it received the **UNESCO Asia-Pacific Award for Cultural Heritage Conservation in 2017**. This prestigious award acknowledged:

- Excellence in conservation practice
- Community involvement in the process
- Sustainable adaptive reuse
- Preservation of authentic character

## The "Revitalising Historic Buildings Through Partnership Scheme"

The Blue House is part of the Hong Kong government's **"Revitalising Historic Buildings Through Partnership Scheme"**, managed by the **Hong Kong Housing Society**. This innovative program aims to:

- Preserve important historic buildings
- Find sustainable contemporary uses for heritage sites
- Engage communities in conservation efforts
- Balance preservation with modern needs
- Create economically viable heritage sites

Under this scheme, the Blue House now operates as:

- **St. James' Settlement - Blue House Cluster**: A heritage and community center
- **Viva Blue House**: A project combining heritage conservation with community living
- **Community museum**: Showcasing Wan Chai's history and local stories
- **Residential units**: Some original residents were able to return and continue living there
- **Cultural venue**: Hosting exhibitions, workshops, and cultural activities

## Current Status and Significance

Today, the Blue House stands as more than just a historic building:

### Living Heritage

Unlike many museums that are frozen in time, the Blue House is a **living community**. Real families continue to reside there, maintaining the social fabric that has existed for decades. This approach, sometimes called "community-led heritage conservation," ensures that:

- The building retains its authentic character
- Traditional neighborhood relationships continue
- Heritage is integrated into daily life
- The community benefits directly from conservation

### Symbol of Successful Preservation

The Blue House has become a symbol of what can be achieved when communities, government, and heritage advocates work together. It demonstrates that:

- Historic buildings can be saved despite development pressures
- Conservation and community needs can be balanced
- Heritage preservation can be economically sustainable
- Traditional architecture has value in modern Hong Kong

### Cultural and Educational Value

The Blue House serves as an educational resource for:

- Architecture students studying traditional construction
- Martial arts practitioners honoring their lineage
- History enthusiasts learning about old Hong Kong
- Urban planners considering heritage conservation models
- Tourists seeking authentic cultural experiences

## A Piece of Hong Kong History Preserved

In a city known for rapid change and vertical growth, the Blue House stands as a horizontal connection to the past. Its survival ensures that future generations can:

- Experience pre-war architectural styles firsthand
- Understand how ordinary Hong Kong people lived in the early 20th century
- Learn about the city's martial arts heritage
- Appreciate the value of preserving cultural landmarks

The Blue House is not just important for martial artists or architecture enthusiasts—it is important for **Hong Kong's heritage itself**. It represents resilience, community, cultural continuity, and the possibility of finding balance between progress and preservation.
